# PythonProgramming-Assignment3-
This is the third application that I wrote for my python programming course

This program uses the A3 Codes.txt file and determines if a code is valid or not. The criteria for a valid code is that it must have at least 10 characters, the positions
4 - 7 must be digits(these represent the country code) and the character in the 10th position must be a capital letter (this represents the security level). It also double
checks within the valid codes to see if it is an invalid restricted code. An invalid restricted code is a code that has a security level of 'R' and a country code of 2000 
or higher. It then adds the code to the valid codes string, the invalid codes string or the invalid restricted codes string accordingly.
